# portfolio-final
For this final project of the data immersion course I utilised python with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit, pylab and folium libraries to conduct an analysis of Airbnb data in Berlin. 

Berlin has a chronic shortage of available and affordable long-term rental apartments. 

In the debate around that Airbnb has been blamed for facilitating the commercial exploitation of apartments, which could otherwise be used as homes for residents. 

The assumption is that for-profit hosts “occupy” and make apartments unavailable to locals as well as rent them out at excessively high prices, pushing up the overall rental costs in the city. 

This issue is central to help combating the cause of the shortage.

In this case study, I will explore the impact of commercial hosts on the Berlin rental market.   

The data sets contain information on Airbnb listings for Berlin scraped from Airbnb in July 2021. 

In the folders you can find my code for: 

- data wrangling, 
- consistency checks,
- visual exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
- creating geographical visualisations: a choropleth map, 
- supervised machine learning: linear regression,
- unsupervised machine learning: clustering,
- time series analysis.  

Time series analysis is not included in the final presentation just as many results of the EDA. 
The final presentation concentrates on the analytical journey and key results. 

In this analysis, I answer questions such as: 

- how can we identify and prove the existence of commercial hosts? 
- what impact do commercial hosts have on price and availability of apartments?  
- which Berlin neighbourhoods are the most popular?
