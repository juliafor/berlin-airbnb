# portfolio-final
For this final project of the data immersion course I utilised python with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit, pylab and folium libraries to conduct an analysis of Airbnb data in Berlin. 

Airbnb has been around for more than 20 years and was initially launched to connect local people (“hosts”) and tourists (“guests”). The idea was to offer guests a “truly” local experience at the destination city while the hosts could make some additional cash by renting out their apartment while out of town. 

Soon, some “hosts” began renting apartments purely for profit. This resulted in an increased amount of apartments in popular cities such as Berlin being used for commercial tourist rentals. This is called misappropriation. 

This case study explores the extent of misappropriation in Berlin. 

The data sets contain information on Airbnb listings for Berlin scraped from Airbnb in July 2021. 

In the folders you can find my code for: 

- data wrangling, 
- consistency checks,
- visual exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
- creating geographical visualisations: a choropleth map, 
- supervised machine learning: linear regression,
- unsupervised machine learning: clustering),
- time series analysis.  

Time series analysis is not included in the final presentation just as many results of the EDA. 
The final presentation concentrates on the analytical journey and key results. 

In this analysis, I answer questions such as: 

- how can we identify and prove the existence of commercial hosts? 
- what impact do commercial hosts have on price and availability of apartments?  
- which Berlin neighbourhoods are the most popular?
